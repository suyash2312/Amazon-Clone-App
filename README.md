# 🛒 Amazon Clone App

A **full-stack Amazon Clone App** built using **Flutter** for the frontend and **Node.js + Express** for the backend, with **MongoDB** as the database. This project replicates the core features of Amazon, including authentication, product browsing, cart management, admin controls, and payments. 

This project helped me learn **mobile app development**, **API integration**, **backend services**, and **database operations** — all in one place. It was developed under the guidance of a mentor who provided the key learning resources.
